# ColdPanel

## What is it?
ColdPanel is a simple, yet powerful, panel to manage Docker containers.
If you want to let your friends to manage your Docker containers, be able to create their own, ColdPanel is perfect for that!

## Sounds good, how do I use it?
The panel is split into 2 sections, the frontend and the backend.
### The backend
This is the brains of the panel, without it nothing would work.
### The frontend
This is the frontend of the panel, without it you wouldn't be able to see what's happening.
Delete the one you don't need. It is possible to run both at the same time.
You should setup a config.json in the base directory of the panel. Follow the [example config.json](./config.example.jsonc) for a guide.
